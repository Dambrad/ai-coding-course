   ```

3. **Create GitHub repository**:
   - Go to github.com
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it: `ai-coding-course`
   - Make it Public (or Private)
   - **Don't** add README, .gitignore, or license (we have them!)
   - Click "Create repository"

4. **Initialize and push**:
   ```bash
   # Initialize git
   git init
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # First commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete AI coding course structure"
   
   # Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-coding-course.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **View your course**:
   Visit `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-coding-course`

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop (Easier)

1. **Install GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com/

2. **Open GitHub Desktop**
